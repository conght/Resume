# Experience

## Xiaomi  (2016.08 - Present)

**Position:  SDE (Backend),  Team: MiLive,  Major Language: C/C++ **

### Revenue System of MiLive

The revenue system is the general term for a series of core projects in MiLive, including recharge & purchase & withdraw & redenvelop & one-by-one pay chat & risk control and so on. I have been working on these projects since I joined Xiaomi on 2016.08, and been in charge of the revenue system from earlier this year. Now I am the leadership of a team which contains two developer. I am responsible for,

- Accessing more than 10 kinds of popular third-party financial services in China and aboard; Refactoring the architecture of recharge service, which improved the success rate significantly.
- Optimizing the architecture of mall service, making services more reliable.
- Designing and implementing new services, such as red-envelope & one-by-one-pay-chat;  Optimizing continuously to make these services more high availability.
- Reform entire revenue system, turning into mircoservices architecture. Other apps of our business group could access these financial services insteal of building their own. The new revenue system support safety isolation.
- Setting up monitoring for each core revenue system module, could monitor the real-time success rate.

In this work experience, I have summed up a set of business models suitable for revenue proejcts. This model can effectively improve business success rate and increase the efficiency of verifying daily statement of account. After becoming the project leader, by standardizing the development process and sorting out the past experience, we improve the project quality significantly. There is ZERO online-bugs about core revenue projects until now. 

### Message System of MiLive 

Message system includes living-room-message & system-notification & downstream-push and IM etc. I took charge of the message system in the beginning of this year. From that time on, my efforts center on these four jobs:

- Reforming the IM in app, making the IM service have the ability to save historical chat message and support chat record roaming. 
- Implementing the function which supports the client to get unread messages either by pushing or by pulling, increasing messages arrival rate. 
- Strengthening the monitoring of pivotal nodes and services.
- Prefecting the documentation of message system.

### Live Message Anti-Spam

For solving the problem of garbage text, I surveyed the main current solutions. 通过使用google开源的机器学习框架TensorFlow，融合了几种深度学习模型TextCNN等，基于实际的线上数据集，训练出了一套能够识别垃圾文本的模型。模型支持识别垃圾文本，还能够对垃圾文本进行分类。具体分类如涉政或广告等。模型的最高准确率可达96%。

## ICBC Software Development Center  (2015.7 - 2016.8)

**Position:  Full-Stack,  Team: Overseas Online Banking,  Major Language: Java**

### ICBC Asia, One-stop Remittance Services 

工银亚洲是工商银行为香港地区提供的网上银行，是工商银行海外用户量最大的网上银行。一站式转账是融合了转账、汇款和工银速汇三者的新型转账工具。

我在此项目负责了前端和后端的全部开发工作。前端开发大量使用jQuery库；后端开发使用的语言为Java，技术栈选用的是IBM提供的WebSphere+BTT作为Java Web的解决方案。

由于银行软件开发中心的特殊性，在参与这个项目过程中，比较困难的问题是开发框架资料不够详实，而且也无法通过互联网搜索。正是这个过程培养了我独立思考的能力和与人沟通的技巧。同时，加深了我对Web开发的理解。
